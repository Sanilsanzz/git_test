    <P>This Burger Recipe covers everything needed to make delightful veggie burgers from scratch, including how to prepare and pan fry delicious homemade vegetable patties. And because no veggie burger is complete without its own special sauce, I have included instruction on how to make the perfect tangy, sweet and spicy mayonnaise dressing.</P>
    <H4>Ingredients</H4>
    <ul>
        <li>vegetables</li>
        <li>spices</li>
        <li>tomato/li>
        <li>buns</li>
        <li>mayo</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your pan on medium-high and cut ground beef in to 1/4 to 1/3 lb golf ball sized chunks. Leave them loose for extra crust!</li>
        <li>Drop the meat in the pan, squash and hold for 5 seconds. Don't be shy, really smash it!</li>
        <li>Watch the edges – once they start to brown through and it’s bubbling up, you’re in the perfect burger zone and ready to flip. Kinda sorta like a pancake. </li>
        <li>Grill the buns in the fat from the burger you just squashed until golden brown. This adds toasty flavor and an extra level of crunch – but be careful, buns cook quickly!</li>
        <li>Condiments – we’ll leave that up to you...</li>
    </ol>
